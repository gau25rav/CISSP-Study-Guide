### Definitions
* War Dialing - technique to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers
* Pentesting Methodology
  * Planning
  * Reconnaissance
  * Scanning(enumeration)
  * Vulnerability Assessment
  * Exploitation
  * Reporting
* Unit Testing - low level, functions, procedures, or objects
* Installation Testing - seeing if it installs and can run
* Integration Testing - multiple components together.  say there is unit test for head lights and one for turn signal. integration test would be making sure they both work at same time
* Regression Testing - testing updates, modifications, or patches
* Acceptance Testing - ensuring it meets standards and requirements
* Fuzzing - black-box testing that submits random, malformed data to see if it will crash
* Dynamic Analysis - giving program inputs to test all paths for bugs, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, etc
* Static Analysis - analyzing the source for for bugs, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, style, etc
* Risk = Threat X Vulnerability

### Design and validate assessment, test, and audit strategies
Pentesting and active assessments.  Once you create something, look for weaknesses or abuse cases
* Internal - usually done by checking logs, scanning internal network with vulnerability scanner, checking camera coverage, etc
* External - analyzing firewall rules, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, fences, gates, etc
* Third-party - paying another organization to test your security for you

### Conduct security control testing
* Vulnerability assessment - describes a ton of weaknesses in the system. Doesn't exploit anything
* Penetration testing - chaining together weaknesses to see what is possible. Puts theirselves in place of attackers to see what they could do
* Log reviews - manually reviewing logs or setting up log analysis tool/filter i.e. splunk
* Synthetic transactions - building scripts to simulate normal activities. this is capture a baseline and simulate traffic
* Code review and testing - manual review, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.  all three should be used
* Misuse case testing - writing security tests. could write a security test to ensure the server redirects you, or that all passwords hashes used are strong
* Test coverage analysis - sees how much code you are testing or covering with dynamic analysis
* Interface testing - testing functionality of interface. ensuring user can't see any weird files, error messages, or anything unneccessary. 

### Collect security process data (e.g., technical and administrative)
* Account management - user accounts should be monitored, permissions checked, and passwords automatically changed
* Management review and approval - weaknesses and risk should always be taken to management before acting. determine what the best plan forward and how much risk they want to accept.
* Key performance and risk indicators - *Key performance indicators is a metric that indicate the positive trend in the security while KRI tracks the risk trend based on the past and current risks* 
* Backup verification data - Information used to verify and manage should be backed up
* Training and awareness - everyone should have to take frequent awarness training and their training should be tracked
* Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) - there should be plans in place for what to do when bad things happen. Is a Hot site, cold site needed? Should everything be completely redundant?

### Analyze test output and generate report
* Policies and Procedures
* Security Personel Training
* Change Management
* Architectural Reviews
* Vulnerability Reports
* Metrics reports on security
* Metrics reports on IT and remediation
* Pentest Reports

### Conduct or facilitate security audits
Same thing as the first title in this section, except you are doing this for real now.
* Internal
* External 
* Third-party
